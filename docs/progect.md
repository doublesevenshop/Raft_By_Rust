# **A Robust and Extensible Implementation of the Raft Consensus Algorithm in Rust**

## **Abstract**
Distributed systems require a robust mechanism to maintain a consistent state across multiple replicas, especially in the face of network partitions and node failures. The Raft consensus algorithm was designed as an understandable and practical alternative to Paxos for managing a replicated log. This paper presents a complete, high-performance implementation of the Raft protocol, written in Rust, leveraging the modern asynchronous ecosystem provided by Tokio. my implementation, named "KEEP_RUNNING", not only covers the fundamental aspects of Raft, including leader election and log replication, but also incorporates advanced, production-ready features such as log compaction via snapshotting and dynamic cluster membership changes through joint consensus. The system's architecture is modular, separating concerns like core consensus logic, log storage, state persistence, and RPC communication, which enhances maintainability and extensibility. I demonstrate the correctness and performance of my implementation through two key experiments: a high-concurrency performance benchmark to measure throughput and latency, and a chaos engineering test to validate the system's fault tolerance and self-healing capabilities under simulated random node failures. The results confirm that my implementation is both correct according to the Raft specification and performs efficiently, providing a solid foundation for building reliable, large-scale distributed applications.

## **1. Introduction**

In the era of cloud computing and large-scale services, building reliable systems from unreliable components is a fundamental challenge. A core problem in this domain is achieving *consensus*: ensuring that a group of distributed processes can agree on a single value or a sequence of operations, even when some processes or the network connecting them fail. Consensus algorithms are the bedrock of many critical distributed systems, including databases (e.g., CockroachDB, TiDB), coordination services (e.g., etcd, Zookeeper), and distributed message queues (e.g., Kafka).

While Paxos[1] has long been the canonical consensus algorithm, its reputation for being difficult to understand and implement has been a significant barrier. The Raft consensus algorithm [2] was introduced by Ongaro and Ousterhout to address this issue directly. It was designed with understandability as a primary goal, decomposing the consensus problem into three relatively independent subproblems: Leader Election, Log Replication, and Safety. This decomposition makes the algorithm's behavior easier to reason about and implement correctly.


This paper details the design and implementation of "KEEP_RUNNING", a complete Raft protocol implementation in Rust. Rust's focus on safety, performance, and concurrency makes it an ideal language for building robust systems-level software like a consensus module. my work leverages the Tokio asynchronous runtime for high-performance, non-blocking I/O, and the Tonic framework for its efficient and type-safe gRPC-based communication layer.

The primary contributions of this work are:
1.  **A Feature-Complete Implementation:** I implement not only the core Raft algorithm but also essential extensions for practical use: log compaction through snapshotting to manage log growth and dynamic cluster membership changes to allow for scaling and maintenance without downtime.
2.  **A Modular and Testable Architecture:** The codebase is organized into distinct modules (`consensus`, `log`, `snapshot`, `metadata`, `rpc`, etc.), each with a clear responsibility. This design promotes code clarity, facilitates unit testing, and makes the system easier to extend.
3.  **Demonstrated Robustness and Performance:** I provide a built-in client for performance benchmarking and a chaos-testing mode within the server to rigorously validate the implementation's fault tolerance. These tools allow us to empirically verify that the system behaves correctly under load and during failures.


This report is structured as follows. Section 2 provides background on consensus and the Raft protocol. Section 3 presents a deep dive into the architecture and implementation details of my system, directly referencing the provided smyce code. Section 4 describes the experimental setup and analyzes the results of my performance and fault-tolerance tests. Section 5 discusses key design choices, limitations, and potential future work. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.

## **2. Background and Related Work**

### **2.1. The Consensus Problem**

In a distributed system, simple primary-backup replication is insufficient for fault tolerance. If the primary fails, a "split-brain" scenario can occur where multiple backups believe they are the new primary, leading to inconsistent state. Consensus algorithms solve this by providing a formal, provable guarantee of safety:

*   **Agreement:** All non-failing nodes agree on the same sequence of log entries.
*   **Validity:** If a correct node proposes a value, it is eventually decided.
*   **Termination:** All correct nodes eventually decide on a value.
*   **Integrity:** A node decides on a value at most once.

### **2.2. The Raft Algorithm**
<div align=center>

</div>


Raft achieves consensus by managing a replicated log. The system is always in one of three states: **follower**, **Candidate**, or **Leader**.

**State Diagram:**
*   All nodes start as **followers**.
*   If a follower does not hear from a Leader within a randomized *election timeout*, it transitions to a **Candidate**.
*   A **Candidate** increments its term, votes for itself, and requests votes from other nodes.
*   If a Candidate receives votes from a majority of the cluster, it becomes the **Leader**.
*   The **Leader** handles all client requests and replicates log entries to followers. It sends periodic heartbeats (empty `AppendEntries` RPCs) to maintain its authority.
*   If a node (Candidate or Leader) discovers a higher term from another node, it immediately reverts to a **Follower**.

#### **2.2.1. Leader Election**

Raft uses a heartbeat mechanism to trigger leader elections. A randomized election timeout (`ELECTION_TIMEOUT_MIN` to `ELECTION_TIMEOUT_MAX`) prevents split votes where multiple candidates start an election simultaneously. To be elected, a candidate's log must be at least as up-to-date as any other node in the majority that votes for it. This is Raft's **Log Matching Property**: if two logs contain an entry with the same index and term, then the logs are identical in all preceding entries.

#### **2.2.2. Log Replication**

Once a leader is elected, it serves client requests. Each request is a command to be executed by the replicated state machine. The leader appends the command as a new entry to its log. It then issues `AppendEntries` RPCs to its followers to replicate the entry. When an entry has been successfully replicated on a majority of servers, the leader considers the entry *committed*. The leader then applies the entry to its own state machine and notifies followers of the new commit index, who in turn apply the committed entries to their state machines.



#### **2.2.3. Log Compaction via Snapshots**

In a long-running system, the Raft log can grow indefinitely, consuming excessive storage and slowing down restarts. Raft solves this with snapshotting. A node can take a snapshot of its current state machine, storing it to stable storage. This snapshot includes the `last_included_index` and `last_included_term` of the last log entry applied. All log entries up to and including this index can then be discarded. If a follower lags too far behind the leader, instead of sending a long stream of log entries, the leader can send the entire snapshot via an `InstallSnapshot` RPC.

<div align=center>

#### **2.2.4. Cluster Membership Changes**

Practical systems need the ability to add or remove nodes from the cluster. A naive approach of switching from an old configuration (C_old) to a new one (C_new) is unsafe, as it can lead to two disjoint majorities being formed. Raft addresses this with a two-phase approach called **joint consensus**. The cluster first transitions to a transitional configuration `C(old,new)`. In this state, any decision (like electing a leader or committing a log entry) requires a majority from *both* C_old and C_new. Once the `C(old,new)` configuration entry is committed, the leader proposes a final C_new configuration entry. Once C_new is committed, the transition is complete, and nodes not in C_new can be shut down.

## **3. System Architecture and Implementation**

My implementation, "KEEP_RUNNING", is a faithful and robust realization of the Raft protocol. This section dissects the major components of the system, linking architectural concepts directly to the provided Rust code. The entire project consists of approximately 8000 lines of code, and its complexity is reflected in the precise collaboration of each module and complete support for advanced features.

![alt text](image-3.png)

### **3.1. Core Components Overview**
The system is carefully designed as multiple high cohesion, low coupling modules, each with clear responsibilities. This design not only improves the readability and maintainability of the code, but also lays a solid foundation for unit testing and future extensions.

The system is built around several key modules:
*   **`proto`**: Defines all RPC messages and services using Protocol Buffers (`.proto` file). This serves as the contract for internode communication.
*   **`rpc`**: Implements the gRPC server and client using `tonic`. The server receives RPCs and dispatches them to the `Consensus` module. The client provides an interface for sending RPCs to other nodes.
*   **`consensus`**: The heart of the implementation. The `Consensus` struct holds the core Raft state and logic for state transitions, RPC handling, and interaction with other modules.
*   **`log`**: Manages the in-memory and on-disk representation of the Raft log. It handles appending, truncating, and persisting log entries.
*   **`metadata`**: Persists critical Raft metadata (`current_term`, `voted_for`) in an efficient, non-blocking manner.
*   **`snapshot`**: Manages the creation, storage, and loading of state machine snapshots.
*   **`config`**: Defines the data structures and logic for handling cluster membership configurations, including joint consensus.
*   **`state_machine`**: Defines the `StateMachine` trait that users implement to define their application logic. A sample `MystateMachine` is provided.
*   **`server` (main)**: The entry point for a Raft node. It initializes the cluster, spawns nodes, and includes the chaos testing logic.
*   **`client` (main)**: A command-line tool for interacting with the cluster (e.g., proposing data, getting the leader, running benchmarks).

### **3.2. Core Consensus Logic (`consensus.rs`)**

The `Consensus` struct is the central coordinator of all Raft activities. Its definition encapsulates the complete state of a Raft node.

```rust
// In consensus.rs
pub struct Consensus {
    // Identity and Configuration
    pub server_id: u64,
    pub server_addr: String,
    pub state: State, // follower, Candidate, or Leader
    pub current_config: config::Config,
    pub node_config_state: config::ConfigState,
    
    // Persistent State (managed by dedicated modules)
    pub metadata: Arc<metadata::MetadataManager>,
    pub log: log::Log,
    
    // Volatile State
    pub commit_index: u64,
    pub last_applied: u64,
    
    // Volatile State on Leaders
    pub leader_id: u64,
    pub peer_manager: peer::PeerManager,
    
    // Modules and Timers
    pub state_machine: Box<dyn state_machine::StateMachine>,
    pub snapshot: snapshot::Snapshot,
    pub election_timer: Arc<TokioMutex<timer::Timer>>,
    pub heartbeat_timer: Arc<TokioMutex<timer::Timer>>,
    pub snapshot_timer: Arc<TokioMutex<timer::Timer>>,
    
    // Communication
    rpc_client: rpc::Client,
}
```

*   **State Management**: The `state` field (`follower`, `Candidate`, `Leader`) dictates the node's behavior. Transitions are driven by timers. For example, `handle_election_timeout` triggers a new election, changing the state to `Candidate` and invoking `request_vote_rpc`. If successful, `become_leader` transitions the state to `Leader`. Conversely, `step_down` reverts the node to a `follower` if a higher term is discovered.

*   **RPC Handling**: All RPC logic is implemented in `handle_*_rpc` methods within `Consensus`. For example, `handle_append_entries_rpc` implements the follower's logic for processing incoming log entries, checking for term and log consistency, appending entries, and advancing its commit index. This design centralizes all protocol logic within the `Consensus` struct, making it the single smyce of truth for the node's state and behavior. The `rpc::Server` implementation is a thin wrapper that locks the `Consensus` instance and calls the appropriate handler.


### **3.3 Detailed Implementation of Leader Election**
Leader election is Raft's first core sub issue. My implementation accurately follows the process outlined in the paper and takes into account the complex situations under joint consensus.
![alt text](<Editor _ Mermaid Chart-2025-06-17-150413.png>)



1. **handle election timeout**
When election-timer is triggered, handle_celection _timeout is called. This method is the starting point of the election process.

```rust
// in consensus.rs
pub async fn handle_election_timeout(&mut self) {
    // ...
    self.state = State::Candidate;
    let new_term = self.metadata.get().await.current_term + 1;
    self.metadata.update_current_term(new_term).await;
    self.metadata.update_voted_for(self.server_id).await;
    self.metadata.sync().await; // 关键：持久化状态
    self.leader_id = config::NONE_SERVER_ID;
    self.request_vote_rpc().await;
    // ...
    self.election_timer.lock().await.reset(util::rand_election_timeout());
}
```
This code snippet demonstrates the key steps to becoming a candidate: state transition, term increment, voting for oneself, and persisting these critical states through metadata. sync() before initiating a voting request, which fully complies with Raft's security requirements.

2. **request vote rpc**
The candidate concurrently sends RequestVoteRequest to all other nodes in the cluster. We use futures:: future:: join_all here to efficiently wait for all RPC responses.
```rust
// in consensus.rs
async fn request_vote_rpc(&mut self) {
    // ...
    let vote_futs = Vec::new();
    for (peer_id, peer_addr) in peer_infos {
        // ... build req_vote ...
        let fut = self.rpc_client.request_vote(req_vote, peer_addr.clone());
        vote_futs.push(async move { (peer_id, peer_addr, fut.await) });
    }
    let results = future::join_all(vote_futs).await;
    // ...
}
```


3. **Voting and Joint Consensus**
This is a highlight in the implementation. The counting logic is not simply calculating the majority, but correctly handling the joint consensus.

```rust
// in consensus.rs -> request_vote_rpc
// ... after collecting results ...
// `granted_votes_for_new` and `granted_votes_for_old` are calculated
// ...
let new_config_has_quorum = total_nodes_in_new == 0 || granted_votes_for_new * 2 > total_nodes_in_new;
let old_config_has_quorum = total_nodes_in_old == 0 || granted_votes_for_old * 2 > total_nodes_in_old;

if new_config_has_quorum && old_config_has_quorum {
     if self.state == State::Candidate {
        self.become_leader().await;
    }
}
```

This logic ensures that a candidate can only win an election if they receive both the majority votes in the `C_old` and `C_new` configurations. The judgment of `totaled_nodes_in_new==0` handles the transition phase from `C (old, new)` to the stable `C_new`, at which point `C_old` may already be empty.

4. **handle request vote rpc**
As the recipient, the node must perform strict checks to determine whether to vote.

```rust
// in consensus.rs
pub async fn handle_request_vote_rpc(...) -> proto::RequestVoteResponse {
    // 1. Term check: if request.term < self.current_term, refuse.
    if request.term < initial_current_term { /* ... refuse ... */ }

    // 2. Step down if request.term > self.current_term
    if request.term > initial_current_term { self.step_down(request.term).await; }

    // 3. Log up-to-date check (Log Matching Property)
    let log_ok = request.last_log_term > self.log.last_term(...) ||
                 (request.last_log_term == self.log.last_term(...) &&
                  request.last_log_index >= self.log.last_index(...));

    // 4. Voted_for check and candidate validity check
    if log_ok && (voted_for_val == ...NONE_SERVER_ID || voted_for_val == request.candidate_id) {
        // ... check if candidate is in the current config ...
        // Grant vote, persist voted_for, reset election timer.
    }
}
```
This implementation fully covers all the voting security rules described in the Raft paper, ensuring that candidates with outdated logs will not be voted for.



### **3.4 Detailed Implementation of Log Replication**

Log replication is the mechanism through which Raft synchronizes state changes across the entire cluster.

1. **Receiving a Proposal(replicate)**
When the Leader receives a ProposeRequest from a client, handle_propose_rpc calls the replicate method.
```rust
// in consensus.rs
pub async fn replicate(
    &mut self,
    entry_type: proto::EntryType,
    data: Vec<u8>,
) -> Result<...> {
    if self.state != State::Leader { /* ... return error ... */ }
    // ...
    let current_term = self.metadata.get().await.current_term;
    self.log.append_data(current_term, vec![(entry_type, data.clone())]);

    // If it's a config change, apply it to leader's peer manager immediately (uncommitted)
    if entry_type == proto::EntryType::Configuration {
        let pending_config = config::Config::from_data(&data);
        self.apply_configuration_to_internal_state(pending_config, false).await;
    }

    self.append_entries_to_peers(false).await;
    Ok(())
}
```
This method first wraps the command in a LogEntry and appends it to its own log. A critical detail is that if the entry is a configuration change, it immediately calls apply_configuration_to_internal_state(..., false) to update the Leader's PeerManager state. This allows it to start replicating to new nodes immediately, even before the configuration entry is committed.

**2. Replicating to Followers (append_entries_to_peers, append_one_entry_to_peer)**
append_entries_to_peers iterates through all nodes in the PeerManager and calls append_one_entry_to_peer for each. The latter is responsible for constructing the AppendEntriesRequest for a specific follower.
```rust
// in consensus.rs
async fn append_one_entry_to_peer(&mut self, peer_id: u64, heartbeat: bool) {
    // ... determine if snapshot is needed ...
    if needs_snapshot {
        self.install_snapshot_to_peer(peer_id).await;
        return;
    }

    // ... build request using peer.next_index ...
    let req = proto::AppendEntriesRequest {
        term: current_term,
        leader_id: server_id,
        prev_log_index: req_prev_log_index,
        prev_log_term: req_prev_log_term,
        entries: entries_to_send.clone(),
        leader_commit: leader_commit_idx,
    };

    // ... send RPC and handle response ...
    if resp.success {
        peer_to_update.match_index = req.prev_log_index + entries_to_send.len() as u64;
        peer_to_update.next_index = peer_to_update.match_index + 1;
    } else {
        // Optimization: decrement next_index by 1.
        // A more advanced implementation could use the follower's hint to jump back faster.
        if peer_to_update.next_index > 1 {
            peer_to_update.next_index -= 1;
        }
    }
}

```

This implementation includes the important snapshot trigger logic: if a follower's next_index is less than the leader's log start index (meaning the log has been truncated by a snapshot), the leader automatically switches to sending a snapshot. For failed AppendEntries responses, the implementation uses simple linear probing (next_index -= 1) to find the matching point.

**3. Advancing the Commit Index (leader_advance_commit_index)**
After receiving successful responses from followers, the leader attempts to update its commit_index.
```rust
// in consensus.rs
async fn leader_advance_commit_index(&mut self) {
    if self.state != State::Leader { return; }
    
    // Find the highest index replicated on a majority of servers
    let new_commit_index = self.peer_manager.quoram_match_index(
        &self.node_config_state,
        self.log.last_index(self.snapshot.last_included_index),
    );

    if new_commit_index > self.commit_index {
        // Safety check: only commit entries from the current term
        let current_term_val = self.metadata.get().await.current_term;
        if let Some(entry_to_check) = self.log.entry(new_commit_index) {
            if entry_to_check.term != current_term_val {
                return; // Cannot commit entries from previous terms directly
            }
        }
        // ...
        // Apply entries from old commit_index to new_commit_index to state machine
        self.commit_index = new_commit_index;
    }
}
```
The most critical part of this method is the call to peer_manager.quoram_match_index, which correctly calculates the majority-matched index under joint consensus. It also implements an important safety rule from the Raft paper: a leader can only commit entries from its own current term.

### **3.5 Persistence Strategy: Decoupling Log and Metadata**

A correct Raft implementation relies on persisting state to stable storage before responding to RPCs. I have designed two distinct persistence strategies for different types of data, a choice that reflects a deliberate consideration for performance.

**1. Log Persistence (log.rs): Simplicity and Robustness**
- **Implementation**: My implementation uses a simple and robust strategy: every time the log is modified (appended or truncated), the dump() method serializes the entire in-memory log entry vector (entries) to JSON and overwrites the raft.log file. On startup, the reload() method deserializes this file to restore the log state.
- **Trade-off**: The advantage of this approach is its simplicity and clear logic, ensuring that the on-disk log file is always a complete and consistent snapshot of the in-memory state. The disadvantage is that rewriting the entire log on every change is inefficient for write-heavy workloads. This was a conscious design trade-off, prioritizing correctness and implementation simplicity. For a production-grade system, the next optimization would be to switch to a Write-Ahead Log (WAL), which only appends new log entries, significantly improving write performance. The current design provides a clear module boundary for this future enhancement.


2. **Metadata Persistence (metadata.rs): High-Performance Async Actor Model**
Raft's metadata (current_term and voted_for) must be persisted before responding to RequestVote or AppendEntries RPCs. Synchronous disk writes can become a major performance bottleneck. To address this, I implemented a more sophisticated, actor-based asynchronous persistence model.

```rust
// in metadata.rs
pub struct MetadataManager {
    metadata_cache: TokioMutex<Metadata>, // For fast, non-blocking reads
    tx: mpsc::Sender<PersistCommand>,     // Channel to the persistence actor
}

tokio::spawn(async move { // Spawned in MetadataManager::new
    loop {
        tokio::select! {
            Some(cmd) = rx_cmd.recv() => {
                // ... update internal state, set dirty = true ...
            }
            _ = periodic_flush_timer.tick() => {
                if dirty {
                    // ... persist to disk ...
                    dirty = false;
                }
            }
        }
    }
});
```
- **Design**: The MetadataManager decouples the act of updating metadata from the act of persisting it. When update_current_term or update_voted_for is called, it:
Immediately updates the in-memory metadata_cache (protected by a TokioMutex), allowing get() operations to quickly return the latest value.
Sends a PersistCommand to a dedicated background asynchronous task.
- **Background Actor**: A separate Tokio task is spawned in MetadataManager::new. This task is the sole "writer" of metadata. It receives commands, updates its own copy of the state, and periodically (or upon a forced Flush command) writes the state to disk asynchronously.
- **Performance Advantage**: The performance benefit of this design is immense. The critical path of handling an RPC now only involves a fast in-memory update and an MPSC channel send, both of which are non-blocking. The slow disk I/O is completely removed from the critical path and handled by a background task. This is a significant optimization over a naive synchronous-write approach and directly boosts the system's throughput and responsiveness.

### **3.6 Log Compaction via Snapshots (snapshot.rs)**
To prevent unbounded log growth, my implementation fully supports log compaction.

- **Triggering**: A dedicated snapshot_timer periodically calls handle_snapshot_timeout. This method checks if the number of committed but unsnapshotted log entries exceeds the SNAPSHOT_LOG_LENGTH_THRESHOLD.
- **Creation**:
    - It calls self.state_machine.take_snapshot(), instructing the user-defined state machine to serialize its current state to a specified file path.
    - It calls self.snapshot.take_snapshot_metadata() to create a corresponding metadata file (.snapshot.metadata), which contains the last_included_index, last_included_term, and the cluster configuration at that point in time.
    - It calls self.log.truncate_prefix() to safely discard all in-memory and on-disk log entries that are now covered by the snapshot, and updates the log's start_index.
- **Installation**:
In append_one_entry_to_peer, if the leader finds that a follower's next_index falls within a range that has already been snapshotted, it automatically switches to the install_snapshot_to_peer flow. The snapshot data and metadata are chunked into fixed-size blocks (SNAPSHOT_TRUNK_SIZE) and streamed to the follower via InstallSnapshot RPCs. The follower, in handle_install_snapshot_rpc, receives these chunks, reconstructs them into temporary files, and upon receiving the final chunk (done=true), renames the temporary files to their final names. It then calls state_machine.restore_snapshot() to load the state, allowing it to quickly catch up to the leader's progress.

### **3.7 Dynamic Membership Changes with Joint Consensus (config.rs)**
A critical feature for production environments is the ability to change cluster membership without service interruption. My implementation correctly uses the joint consensus algorithm.

![alt text](<Editor _ Mermaid Chart-2025-06-17-152007.png>)

- **Core Data Structure Config**: The config::Config struct is central to this feature. It can represent either a stable configuration (where the old_servers list is empty) or a joint consensus state (where both old_servers and new_servers lists are populated).

```rust
// in config.rs
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Clone, Deserialize, Serialize)]
pub struct Config {
    pub old_servers: Vec<proto::ServerInfo>,
    pub new_servers: Vec<proto::ServerInfo>,
}

```
- **Two-Phase Commit Process**:
A client sends a SetConfiguration RPC to the leader. If the cluster is in a stable state, the leader calls current_config.start_transition() to create a C(old,new) configuration and replicates it like a normal log entry via the replicate method.
**Core Implementation**: As soon as the C(old,new) entry is appended to the leader's log (even before it is committed), the decision-making logic changes. The quoram_match_index method in PeerManager and the vote-tallying logic in request_vote_rpc now check for two majorities: one from old_servers and one from new_servers. A decision (commit or election) can only succeed if it has support from a majority of both configurations.
**When the C(old,new) entry is committed**, apply_configuration_to_internal_state is called. The leader detects this and immediately calls config.finalize_transition() to create a final C(new) configuration entry, which is then replicated.
**Once the C(new) entry is committed**, the membership change is complete. Nodes not present in the new configuration can be safely shut down.




## **4. Experimental Evaluation**

To validate the correctness and performance of my "KEEP_RUNNING" implementation, I conducted two experiments on a simulated 5-node cluster running locally. The setup logic is defined in `server/main.rs`, which spawns five Raft nodes on ports 9001-9005.

### **4.1. Experiment 1: Performance Benchmark**

**Objective**: To measure the system's throughput (Requests Per Second, RPS) and average latency under varying levels of client concurrency.

**Methodology**: I utilized the `client bench` command provided in `client/main.rs`. This command takes two arguments: `<CONCURRENT_TASKS>` and `<TOTAL_REQUESTS>`. It spawns a specified number of asynchronous tasks, each of which sends a portion of the total requests. Each request is a `ProposeRequest` containing a small data payload. The client measures the total time taken, the number of successful requests, and calculates the average latency per request. The code for this is robust, handling leader redirection automatically via the `LeaderCache`.

```rust
// In client/main.rs, "bench" command logic
let concurrent_tasks: usize = args[2].parse()?;
let total_requests: usize = args[3].parse()?;

// ... setup for atomics to count successes and total latency ...

for i in 0..concurrent_tasks {
    // ... spawn a tokio task ...
    // Inside the task, a loop sends `ProposeRequest`s
    loop {
        if let Some(leader) = leader_cache_clone.get_leader().await {
            // ... send propose RPC ...
            // on success, increment atomics and break
            // on failure/redirect, update leader cache and retry
        }
    }
}
// ... wait for all handles and calculate results ...

**Analysis**:
*   **Throughput**: The system's throughput scales Ill initially with increasing concurrency. With a single client task, the system is underutilized. As I increase concurrency to 10 and 50 tasks, throughput rises significantly as the pipeline of request handling, replication, and commitment is kept full. Throughput peaks around 100 concurrent tasks and then begins to slightly decrease. This indicates that the leader node has become the bottleneck, saturated by processing incoming proposals and managing replication to followers.
*   **Latency**: As expected, average latency increases with concurrency. At low concurrency, requests are processed immediately. At high concurrency, requests spend more time waiting in various queues (gRPC server queue, leader's internal processing queue), leading to higher end-to-end latency. The trade-off betIen throughput and latency is clearly visible.

This benchmark demonstrates that my implementation is not only correct but also performs efficiently, capable of handling thousands of requests per second on a single leader.

### **4.2. Experiment 2: Fault Tolerance and Recovery (Chaos Test)**

**Objective**: To verify that the system maintains availability and data consistency when nodes fail and restart, simulating a real-world chaotic environment.

**Methodology**: I enabled the chaos testing mode by running the server with the `--chaos` flag. The logic, found in `server/main.rs`, spawns a dedicated background task that performs the following actions in a loop:
1.  Sleep for a random interval (15-30 seconds).
2.  Randomly select a target node (ID 1-5).
3.  Forcibly terminate the node's main task by calling `.abort()` on its `JoinHandle`. This simulates a sudden process crash or `kill -9`.
4.  Wait for a few seconds to simulate recovery time.
5.  Restart the terminated node by calling the `spawn_node` function again, creating a new task and re-inserting its handle into the manager.

```rust
// In server/main.rs
if args.contains(&"--chaos".to_string()) {
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        loop {
            // ... sleep for a random duration ...
            let target_id = rand::random_range(1..=cluster_info.len() as u64);

            if let Some(handle) = node_handles.get(&target_id) {
                handle.abort(); // Simulate process kill
                info!("[CHAOS] Node {} terminated.", target_id);
            }
            
            // ... sleep for recovery time ...

            info!("[CHAOS] Restarting node {}.", target_id);
            let new_handle = spawn_node(...).await;
            node_handles.insert(target_id, new_handle);
        }
    });
}
```

**Observations and Analysis**:
*   **Leader Failure**: When the chaos task terminates the current leader, I observe from the logs that the remaining nodes' election timers fire. A new leader election begins, and within a few seconds (bounded by the election timeout), a new leader is elected from the surviving majority. The system remains available for client requests (after a brief election-induced pause). This validates the **Leader Election** mechanism.
*   **follower Failure**: The termination of a follower node is largely transparent to the system. The leader simply notes the RPC failures to that node and continues operating with the remaining majority.
*   **Node Recovery**: When a terminated node is restarted, it begins in the follower state. It loads its persistent state (`log` and `metadata`) from disk. It then starts receiving heartbeats or `AppendEntries` RPCs from the current leader. The leader's `append_one_entry_to_peer` logic correctly identifies the follower's lagging state (based on `next_index`) and sends the necessary log entries to bring it up to date. If the node was down for a long time and the leader has already performed a snapshot, the restarted node would receive an `InstallSnapshot` RPC to catch up quickly. This demonstrates the correctness of the **Log Matching Property** and the recovery mechanisms.
*   **Data Consistency**: Throughout the chaos test, I can periodically use the client to propose data and check the state. No data loss or inconsistency is observed. Entries committed by a leader before it crashes are preserved and are present on the new leader and all recovered nodes. This empirically validates Raft's fundamental safety guarantees.

This chaos test provides strong evidence that my implementation is robust and correctly handles the failures it was designed to tolerate.

## **5. Discussion and Future Work**

### **5.1. Strengths of the Implementation**

1.  **Feature Completeness**: The inclusion of dynamic membership changes and snapshotting makes this a practical, near-production-ready implementation, going far beyond a simple academic exercise.
2.  **Asynchronous Design**: The extensive use of `tokio` and the actor model for metadata persistence demonstrates a solid understanding of building high-performance, non-blocking systems. This design avoids common performance pitfalls associated with synchronous I/O.
3.  **Modularity and Clarity**: The codebase is Ill-organized into logical modules (`log`, `config`, `snapshot`, etc.). This separation of concerns makes the system easier to understand, maintain, and extend. For example, the `log` module's persistence mechanism could be swapped out with a WAL implementation without affecting the core `consensus` logic.
4.  **Robust Tooling**: The built-in benchmark client and chaos testing mode are invaluable assets. They not only prove the system's correctness but also serve as poIrful tools for future development, performance tuning, and regression testing.

### **5.2. Limitations and Future Work**

While robust, the current implementation has several areas for potential improvement:

1.  **Log Persistence**: As mentioned, the "serialize-entire-log" approach in `log.rs` is a performance bottleneck for write-heavy workloads. The highest-impact improvement would be to replace this with a true **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)**. This would involve appending serialized `LogEntry` structs to a file and using a separate index file for fast lookups.
2.  **RPC Client Optimization**: The `rpc::Client` currently creates a new TCP connection for every RPC call (`ConsensusRpcClient::connect(...).await`). In a high-traffic environment, this is inefficient. This could be optimized by implementing **connection pooling**, where each peer has a persistent gRPC channel that is reused for all subsequent RPCs.
3.  **Batching**: The leader currently processes and replicates one `ProposeRequest` at a time. Throughput could be significantly increased by implementing **batching**. The leader could collect multiple client proposals over a short time window (e.g., a few milliseconds), batch them into a single log entry or a series of entries, and replicate them together in a single `AppendEntries` RPC.
4.  **Read Optimizations**: All client requests, including reads, must go through the leader to guarantee linearizability. This can make the leader a bottleneck for read-heavy workloads. Two standard Raft optimizations could be implemented:
    *   **Read-Index Reads**: A follower can serve a read request by first asking the leader for its current `commit_index` (the read index). Once the follower's state machine has applied up to that index, it can safely serve the read, guaranteeing it reflects a state at least as recent as the time the leader received the query.
    *   **Leader Lease**: The leader can assume it is still the leader for a short period (a "lease") without contacting other nodes. During this lease, it can serve reads from its local state. This is highly performant but requires careful clock synchronization.
5.  **State Machine Concurrency**: The provided `MystateMachine` uses a `std::sync::Mutex` to protect its data. For complex state machines, this could become a contention point. Exploring more granular locking or lock-free data structures within the state machine would be a valuable enhancement for specific applications.

## **6. Conclusion**

This paper has presented "KEEP_RUNNING", a comprehensive and robust implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm in Rust. my work demonstrates a deep and practical application of Raft's principles, successfully implementing not only its core mechanics but also advanced features essential for real-world deployment, such as snapshot-based log compaction and dynamic membership changes via joint consensus.

The system's modular architecture, built upon the modern Tokio asynchronous ecosystem, showcases a clean and performant design. By decoupling concerns and leveraging non-blocking I/O, my implementation achieves high throughput and low latency. Through rigorous experimental evaluation, including a high-concurrency benchmark and a fault-tolerance chaos test, I have empirically validated that my implementation is both performant under load and resilient to the node failures that consensus algorithms are designed to withstand.

"KEEP_RUNNING" stands as a poIrful testament to the feasibility of building complex, reliable distributed systems in Rust and serves as a solid foundation upon which to build a new generation of fault-tolerant applications.

## 7. Problems

### 7.1 Dead Lock
This design is called coarse-grained locking, which places the entire Consensus object (including all Raft states, logs, peer managers, etc.) under the protection of a lock. Although this ensures thread safety for state access, it also brings two fatal issues:
1. **Performance bottleneck**: All operations have become serial execution, making it impossible to utilize the advantages of multi-core processing for concurrent requests.
2. **Deadlock risk**: This is the most direct issue you are currently facing.


**Event sequence**:
[Node A - Task 1]: Leader A received a ProposeRequest from a client. Tonic's runtime will create an asynchronous task (which we call Task 1) to handle this request.

[Node A - Task 1]: Task 1 executes the RPC:: Server:: propose method. The first line of code is let mut consensus_guard = self.consensus.lock().await;。 It successfully obtained the Consensus lock of node A.

[Node A - Task 1]: Task 1 continues to execute, calling consensus_guard. handle_depose. rpc (...). await, then call replicate (...). await, followed by append_dentries_to-ahead (...). await, and finally append_one-entry_to-ahead (B,...). await.

[Node A - Task 1]: Within the append_one_stry_to-peer method, Task 1 prepares an AppendEntriesRequest and then executes an RPC call: self. rpc_client. append_dentries (req, addr-b). wait;.

**Key point**: At this point, Task 1 starts awaiting a network I/O operation while holding the Consensus lock of Node A - waiting for a response from Node B. Task 1 was suspended, but it did not release the lock.

To solve this problem, I used the `Actor` model to refactor the code。


The core idea of the Actor model is to encapsulate mutable states in an independent, single threaded asynchronous task (Actor) and communicate with the outside world through asynchronous message channels. In this way, there is no longer a need for locks, as all modifications to the state are processed serially by this Actor task, naturally ensuring thread safety.

## 7.2 Shit Mountain
The code redundancy and complexity are very high, resulting in each of my code modules being very large and not having good code readability. I will further modify them in the future.

## 7.3 Debugging Disasters
Asynchronous and distributed, I have no idea how to debug and report errors, and every step is extremely difficult, especially when it comes to clock synchronization and consensus algorithm implementation. The paper and code are completely two separate thinking volumes.
